  <p align="center">Hello and welcome! Name's Sydney. I'm yet another programmer whose trying to make random things that I find useful! Mostly, I work on Discord bots, but I also work on other projects sometimes. I mainly work in JavaScript, TypeScript, but I know a few other languages as well! 😁 I may not be the best at it, but I do try my hardest to make sure everything I make works and functions! I'm not on GitHub a lot but I'm on Discord quite often at <b>yukii#6035</b> so you could reach me there if you want to chat :)
